# Movies API

## Workflow

1. Fork and clone this repo.
1. Run `npm install`.
1. Write your code in `src/server.js`. You can split code into separate files if needed.
1. In `package.json` already exists `start` script to run your server.

## Task

Use data from `data.json` to create express server with next endpoints:

1. Create a GET API on `/movies` that returns all movies, ordered by the release year, as JSON.

1. Create a GET API on `/movies/<id>` that retrieves the single movie corresponding to the movie with the provided ID. If there is no such movie, return 404.

1. Create a GET API on `/movies/titles` that returns the titles of all the movies, ordered alphabetically, as plain text (titles to be separated with a linebreak).

1. Create a GET API on `/movies/titles?year=<year>` that returns the titles of all the movies released in the given year, ordered alphabetically, as plain text (separating titles with a linebreak).

## Extra task
(Require file system opperations and body parsing)

1. Create a POST API on `/movies` that inserts a new movie with the provided title and release year into the `data.json` and return created movie (with id) as JSON. Request should contains body with movie object(`{ "title": "Title", "year": 1984, "imdbRating": 9.1 }`). Use [uuid](https://www.npmjs.com/package/uuid) library to create new ID\`s(`const uuid = require('uuid/v4'); const id = uuid()`)

1. Create a PUT API on `/movies/<id>` that updates the given movie in `data.json` by id with the provided title and year. For the response, return the updated movie (with id) as JSON. Request should contains body with movie object(`{ "title": "Title", "year": 1984, "imdbRating": 9.1 }`).

1. Create PATCH API on `/movies/<id>` similar to PUT request, but request body may content not all keys, but few of them(at least 1). Ex: `{ "year": 1990 }`, `{ "title": "New Title", "imdbRating": 10 }` Rewrite values of these keys in the corresponding object in `data.json`. Response should be the same as in the PUT method.

1. Create a DELETE API on `/movies/<id>` that removes the specified movie from the `data.json`. Response without content with 204 status code.

1. Make sure your server is fault-tolerant and will continue to serve clients even after receiving an invalid request. For instance, if the string "im-a-text-not-a-number" is passed as a release year for a movie, the server shouldnâ€™t crash.

## MVC (without View)

Separate application logic into
- model(works with data)
- controllers(handle requests, send responses)

1. Create `models` folder and `movies-model.js` inside. Module should export object with methods to retrieve or update data in file. Methods may accept arguments and should return promises.

1. Create `controllers` folder and `movies-controller.js` inside. Module should export object with 
methods according to each endpoint. Controller should import and use movies model.

1. Create file `router.js`. Create and export express.Router there. Import controller and add all application routes inside `router.js`. Also, you could add middlewares like `express.json()` here.

1. For now `server.js` should only create `express` application, import and use `router` and start server listening.

1. Use environment variable for server port. Use `path` library to join file system paths.

You can create any additional files you need. You may use [this article](https://medium.com/@dinyangetoh/how-to-build-simple-restful-api-with-nodejs-expressjs-and-mongodb-99348012925d) as an example.
